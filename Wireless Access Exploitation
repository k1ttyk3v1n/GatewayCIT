*This will only work if you have a capture file already and it contains enough IVs.
*May take a long time for WPA
If you have a capture file run command from folder your pcap or cap file is in
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt default.pcap
Any wordlist you would like to use can be substituted and obviously put in the name of your pcap file where default is.
